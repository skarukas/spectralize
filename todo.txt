FIXES:

- port harmonics and partial stuff into masterSpectrum or get rid of it
- fix setFundamental, and get a way to retrieve the fundamental
- for stretched spectra, make it so "partials of partials" are calculated correctly 
    - octave = (12 * stretch)
- maybe just remove stretch for MasterSpectrum
- process notes before running any analysis
- store analysis in Results (rename) then output all at the same time
- fix "Adjust to lowest pitch" or meanmode options
- make sure when stretch and shift are applied masterSpectrum is regenerated to 
    guarantee a chromatic octave
- fix setIntensity (calls everything whenever changed, but sometime there are no notes)

ADD:

- create makeKeyboardSpectrum to display every partial of the current spectrum
