- note-ons get stuck (issue with poly~). Has to do with message ordering, sometimes note-offs do not reach the adsr
- tuning issues! and missed note-ons. Likely a result of notesIn message and the HARMONICS change. check createOffsets().
- fix meanMode. Either keep lowest note of chord ET or make f0 ET
- no visual feedback when all notes turn off--make the plot~ respond (hide all plots?)
- patching is disorganized
- octave offset feature/display is not very useful
- fix the unneeded toStrings and fromsymbols
- split up route map out of js
- organize plot~ settings

- combine with justin
- display slide behavior in plot

- discrepancy between octave numbers in plot and f0 display
